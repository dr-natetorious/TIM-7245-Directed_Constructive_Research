# Review your Constructive Purpose Statement

## Instructions

For this assignment, you will refine the purpose statement that you have already created in your previous course work. If you refined your problem statement based on feedback from Week 1, your biggest consideration here is to ensure that your purpose statement still specifically aligns to the problem statement. If you created a new problem statement in Week 1, you will need to create a new purpose statement as well. This can be time consuming, so make sure that you get to work right away if you are starting completely over.

Refine your purpose statement, ensuring that all the following components are incorporated:

- Begin with a succinct sentence to indicate the method and goal of the research
- Description of the intent of the study
- Statement of reason for conducting the study
- Alignment to the problem statement
- Identify the tools and artifacts you will create, modify, or apply and their relation to the problem
- Identify any high level performance goal(s) of your artifact(s)
- Include theoretical implications and generalizability/transferability.

Length: 1 Concise Paragraph
