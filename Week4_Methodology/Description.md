# Applying a Theoretical Framework

Now that you have your problem, purpose, and research questions all completed and aligned, you will work on the theoretical framework for your study. Hopefully you already have the theory or theories picked out that you intend to use for your study, and you have already done some research on the theory or theories you selected.

Your study must be grounded in theory, so you will use this section to discuss the theory or theories that provide the theoretical foundation for your work. You will use the relevant literature to complete this section, and it is likely you will need to use seminal work from the original theorist(s), as well as how the theory or theories have evolved to what they are today. You will need to provide details as to how your own research fits within the theory or theories you chose here, and you will also need to make sure that you look at the assumptions, principles, issues, perspectives, and any controversies in relation to the theory or theories you include for your study.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully.  You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
