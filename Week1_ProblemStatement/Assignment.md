# Revise your Constructive Problem Statement

For this assignment, you will refine the problem statement that you have already created in your previous course work. If you wish to create a new problem statement here, please work with your professor on this, as this course is more of a refinement course, so if you start over, you will have more work to do.  It may also help to share your past professors’ feedback with your current professor.

Refine your problem statement, ensuring that all the following components are incorporated:

Clear and concise statement of the problem
Brief discussion of problem and documentation of the need for and importance of the study
Description of the problem that prompted the study
Relevant primary sources to document existence of dissertation-worthy research (NOTE: Lack of research is not an acceptable problem)
Documentation of clear theoretical implications to make a substantive contribution to the field.
Length: 250 – 300 words

Your plan should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts that are presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect doctoral-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
