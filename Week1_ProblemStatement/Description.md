# Refining a Problem Statement

The very first part of your research journey is developing the research problem that you will address in your study. This can often be the most difficult part of the process, because it is important to have this 100% perfected before you can move forward. It is also often difficult, because you have to find a problem that exists and needs to be researched, and the problem needs to be within your field of education, so in this case your problem will relate to Technology and Innovation Management.

One of the biggest mistakes you could make in developing a problem statement is a statement that is too broad. Keep in mind that this is one small research paper in a vast world of research, so you really want to make sure that you have narrowed the scope of the problem down to a manageable piece that you will be able to study in the process of writing your dissertation. If you are having trouble narrowing your scope, perhaps you want to look at some other dissertations to see how narrow the scope is to help you better figure out specifically how narrow this problem statement must be.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully.  You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.

## Heads Up to the Signature Assignment

At the end of each course you will complete a Signature Assignment. For this course, that assignment will be for you to develop your final version of your Concept Paper, which is the first document required in the dissertation process. Make sure that you review all requirements for the Concept Paper and be building it as you move throughout the different assignments within the course.
