# Refine the Design for the Study based on the Methodology

For the research method and design section of your concept paper, you will include the following:

- Discussion of proposed research method
- Design & application
  - Details on artifacts to be created, extended, modified, adapted, or used
  - Procedures for employing the artifacts to help solve the problem
- Measurement & evaluation
  - Data sets and other resources to be used
  - Measurements to be taken
  - Evaluation or success criteria, with justification (note: unless you are exploring an entirely new problem, there will already likely be performance benchmarks for your particular situation).
  
Length:  3-5 pages, not including title page and references

Your design should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts that are presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect graduate-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
