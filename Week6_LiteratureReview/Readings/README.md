## Poor level of knowledge on elderly care (2020)

Muhsin, A. A., Munyogwa, M. J., Kibusi, S. M., & Seif, S. A. (2020). Poor level of knowledge on elderly care despite positive attitude among nursing students in Zanzibar Island: findings from a cross-sectional study. BMC Nursing, 19(1), 1–8. [doi](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-020-00488-w). [PoorLevelKnowledge](PoorLevelKnowledge.pdf).

> It is estimated by the year 2050, 80% of the global elderly population will be from the low-and middle income countries.
> This study generally found poor knowledge and positive attitude towards elderly care among nursing students in
Zanzibar. Students living with an elderly person at home and those from extended family were more likely to have
good knowledge and positive attitude towards elderly. Further, students at public institutions and those from
rural areas were associated with positive attitudes.
