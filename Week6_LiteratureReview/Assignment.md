# Assignment: Develop a Literature Review

This week, you will develop your brief literature review based on the research you conducted and the annotated bibliography you created in Week 5. You need to include the following in your literature review:

- Integrated critical analysis and synthesis of the scholarly, peer reviewed literature
- Identify themes or sub-topics to organize the literature review
- Include a minimum of 10 scholarly sources in the literature review. NOTE: More research can be used here, as you will need to add much more to this before your dissertation is complete.
- Alternate or opposing perspectives on themes and topics
- Main ideas in the field of study
- Germinal, seminal, and current (within the past five years) research included
- Emphasis of key findings in the literature
- Focus on concepts rather than theorists or authors.

Length: 6-8 pages, not including title page and references

References: Include a minimum of 10 scholarly resources

Your literature review should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts that are presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect graduate-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
